          <h2>Turtle Categories</h2>
          <p>Turtles are an absolute beauty to watch! These creatures move with vanity and are very flamboyant with their beatiful shells and fins, which makes it blissfull for us to watch them. But, it's not everywhere on earth you can see these wonderful beings. However, Sri Lanka is blessed to have it's sea become a haven for sea turtles. Sri Lankan seas are home to 5 out of the 7 sea turtle types on earth. You will see blow these 5 types of sea turtles and some important facts about them.

          <h2>Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas)</h2>
                    <p>As the sole herbivore among the several kinds, the green turtle is one of the biggest sea turtles. It is their cartilage and fat, not their shells, that give green turtles their name. Green turtles with darker shells are referred to as "black turtles" by locals in the Eastern Pacific. In tropical and subtropical waters, green turtles are most common. Between their feeding sites and the beaches where they hatched, they travel great distances, just like other sea turtles do. The overharvesting of green turtle eggs, adult turtle hunting, entanglement in fishing gear, and loss of nesting beaches are among the threats to this species, which is listed as endangered.</p>

          <h2>Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata)</h2>
                    <p>The word "hawksbill" refers to a bird's short, pointed beak. On their shells, they have a peculiar pattern of interlocking scales that give the edges a serrated appearance. These are quite precious and frequently sold as "tortoiseshell" due to their colorful and patterned shells. Hawksbills are primarily found in coral reefs in the tropical oceans of the world. They mostly eat sponges, which they pull from reef crevices using their tiny, pointed beaks, although they also consume sea anemones and jellyfish. The only surviving members of a group of reptiles that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years are sea turtles. They are an essential component of marine ecosystems and support the survival of seagrass meadows and coral reefs.</p>

          <h2>Loggerhead (Caretta caretta)</h2>
                    <p>The enormous heads of loggerhead turtles support strong jaw muscles that enable them to crush hard-shelled prey like clams and sea urchins, hence the name of the species. Compared to other sea turtles, they are less likely to be killed for their meat or shell. Because loggerhead turtles commonly interact with fisheries, bycatch, or the unintentional capture of marine animals in fishing gear, is a significant issue for them. The most prevalent type of turtle in the Mediterranean is the loggerhead, which breeds on beaches from Greece and Turkey to Israel and Libya. Development of the tourism industry has put many of their nesting beaches in danger. The only surviving members of a group of reptiles that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years are sea turtles. They are an essential component of marine ecosystems and support the survival of seagrass meadows and coral reefs.</p>

          <h2>Leatherback Turtle (Dermochelys coriacea)</h2>
                    <p>The name "leatherback" refers to the leather-like, as opposed to a hard, like other turtles' shell, that this species of turtle has. They are the biggest species of sea turtle and among those that migrate the most, traveling across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Every summer and fall, Pacific leatherbacks travel from their nesting beaches in the Coral Triangle all the way to the California coast to dine on the profusion of jellyfish. Although they are widely distributed, the number of leatherback turtles has drastically decreased over the past century due to extensive egg collection and bycatch in fisheries. Although the IUCN lists the leatherback as Vulnerable globally, certain subpopulations (such as those in the Pacific and Southwest Atlantic) are Critically Endangered</p>

          <h2>Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea)</h2>
                    <p>This sea turtle's name is related to the shade of olive green that may be seen on its shell. Of all sea turtles, they are currently the most prevalent. Due to the fact that they only nest in a few number of locations, any disturbance to even one nest beach might have a significant impact on the entire population.</p>
