          <h2>Threats To Turtles</h2>
          <p>
            Six out of the Seven world Turtle species are found to be endangered. As Sri Lankan waters house five of these seven species, The turtles found in Sri Lankan waters are very vulnerable. There are many reasons why sea turtles are endangered and many of these reasons are caused by human behavior. Therefore, It is vital that we understand these threats to prevent possible harm to turtles. Listed below, are some of the significant threats posed towards turtles in Sri Lankan waters and in other seas.

                Despite the fact that tiger sharks and killer whales have been observed to prey on sea turtles, they have few natural predators as adults. Yet, when they are young, especially as hatchlings, they are incredibly vulnerable to predators like fish, crabs, birds, and mammals. Many scavengers find egg nests to be an appealing food source. The black market is a lucrative market for turtles and their eggs. Turtle eggs are sold to other Asian nations because they are seen to be an aphrodisiac and a sign of fertility by many. Every year, hundreds of thousands of eggs are stolen.

                Due of its scarcity, the hell of the turtle is in high demand for ornamental uses like combs and hair slides. Due to unlawful "tortoiseshell" trafficking, the critically endangered Hawksbill has been hunted to the point of extinction. Poachers in Sri Lanka, where poverty is pervasive, steal the eggs from sea turtle nests around the south and southwest coast in order to sell them on the black market. Female green turtles that are nesting—the most prevalent turtle in Sri Lanka—are killed for their meat, a delicacy throughout Asia. A year sees thousands of deaths. In coastal communities all throughout the world, turtles are a highly sought-after food source because of the high production of high-quality flesh and the simplicity with which they may be caught. Many people regard turtle soup to be a rare delicacy despite the fact that it is frequently found on Asian menus.            </p>

                The economic backbone of Sri Lanka is the fishing sector in the oceans surrounding the country. Nevertheless, a lot of turtles perish after unintentionally getting hooked in fishermen's nets. Globally, this figure can reach 300,000 annually. Moreover, turtles are susceptible to extreme weather, habitat loss or degradation, and contamination of the sea or beaches, most of which is a result of human activities.            </p>

                Turtle nesting can also be discouraged by human activities on beaches, and artificial lighting use close to beaches has been shown to confuse both nesting turtles and their hatchlings. We’ve also seen how recent calamities such as the incidents involving MT New Diamond and X-Press Pearl vessels causing substantial detriments to the marine biology in Sri Lankan waters. These two recent incidents saw significant harm to sea turtles nested in Sri Lankan waters. Disasters of this scale might have been cleaned up after, However it’s impact is irreversible.        </div>
